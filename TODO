START AGAIN!

- Get rid of presets in wireframe {x}

- Rethink sections of HTML... table body can be targeted! Form portion looks okay. {x}
    - Target footer with total monthly cost {x}


- Get rid of all the handle submit type listeners, should only need one if employee is rolled
    into object. Sumbit function should be object w/ 5 key value pairs. Last value needs to be a number. Event prevent please. {x}

- CONSOLE LOGS in every function {x}

- Work on render... has to be function render(), just bare minimum to start {x}
    - Get employee info into DOM targeting HTML id in <main> {x}
    - Target footer with total monthly cost {x}

- There needs to be a delete function, it needs a listener. Will be in the last column of the table being created. {x}

- Work on the math logic... needs to calculate total monthly salary for all employees (annualSalary/12). If monthly salary totals > $20,000
    CSS should target total monthly cost {x}
    Conditional for total monthly > 20,000 {x}

-Update this TODO again most likely {x}
